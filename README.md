radar\_tools
============

*radar_tools* is a set of libraries and scripts useful for visualizing and
processing data collected from ice-penetrating radar. The tools have been
designed to work the HDF5 datasets generated by [Blue
System's](http://www.radar.bluesystem.ca/) IceRadar.

There are two primary ways of using **radar_tools**. The first is to use the
command-line and graphical tools, listed below. These tools provide an
efficient and simple way to apply established methodologies for analysing radar
data. Pre-written filters and processing routines are called by typing
keywords.

The second way is to use the ``irlib`` API directly. This makes it possible to
programmatically analyze radar data from the Python programming language. New
filters and processing routines can be implemented using the API.

Finally, there is experimental support for reading other types of datasets
using *radar_tools*. Right now, it's possible to read CReSIS lines, which makes
the filters in `irlib` available. An example of a helper function to load
CReSIS \*.mat files is in ``itools.py``

Graphical tools:
----------------

- **irview**: General purpose viewer for radar lines that doubles as a tool for
  marking englacial regions

- **icepick**: Pick reflection arrivals from a radar line, either manually or
  with simple pattern recognition

- **icerate**: Rate reflection quality using **icepick** output

Command-line tools:
-------------------

- **h5_dumpmeta**: Dump metadata from an HDF5 survey into a CSV file
- **h5_add_utm**: Add UTM coordinates to an HDF5 survey file (requires
  [**pyproj**](http://code.google.com/p/pyproj/))
- **h5_replace_gps**: Replace the coordinates in an HDF5 survey with those from
  a hand-held GPS
- **h5_generate_cache**: Generate caches to speed loading radar lines
- **h52a**: Export a line from an HDF5 file to ASCII or binary
- **irtrace**: Plot a radar trace acquired at a single location
- **irline**: Plot a radar section along a line of locations

Dependencies:
-------------

*radar_tools* should run anywhere Python and the required dependencies work. In
the past, I've managed to get it working under Windows, OS X, and Linux.

1. [*Python*](http://www.python.org) 2.6+ (&lt;3.x): dynamic interpretted
programming language suited for scientific computing

2. [*Numpy*](http://www.scipy.org) numerical array classes for Python

2. [*Scipy*](http://www.scipy.org) science-oriented libraries for Python

2. [*matplotlib*](http://www.matplotlib.org) plotting for Python

2. [*h5py*](https://github.com/h5py/h5py): HDF5 interface for Python

One way to get the first four dependencies above in one package is to install
the [Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com/).

Additional useful packages and tools:
-------------------------------------

1. [*Cython*](cython.org) for generating accelerated filters (cython.org)

2. *pywavelet* wrapper for wavelet algorithms (*Torrence and Compo, 1998*)
(included in `external/pywavelet-0.1`)

2. [*pyproj*](code.google.com/p/pyproj) _libproj_ bindings

Documentation:
--------------

In addition to the basic information here, documentation can be found in `doc`.
In order to build the documentation, [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) must be
installed, with the ``numpydoc`` extension. The extensions can be installed by

    easy_install numpydoc

Then, type

    make html

If LaTeX is available, the documentation can be compiled into a PDF. Type

    make latexpdf


Changes in irlib version 0.4-dev
--------------------------------

*irlib* 0.4 represents significant refactoring and cleaning of both the library
and app design. Breaking changes in the final version will be kept to a minimum,
bit the development period may be a bit turbulent. Use the *stable-0.3* branch in
the meantime.

Implemented
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - remove deprecated `CutSingle`, `CutRegion` methods
    - refactor pickable gathers into separate subclasses
    - refactor CLI filter commands into filter classes to allow introspection
    - map window
    - refactor icepick, irview, icerate into a single codebase, kept in
      `irlib/app/` (partial)
    - build *icepick2* based on the refactored `app` codebase (partial)

To do
~~~~~

    - composable line gathers and surveys by overloading arithmetic operators
    - HDF file write
    - project config file
